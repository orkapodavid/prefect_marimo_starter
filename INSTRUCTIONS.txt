# Instructions for Setting Up Exchange Notifications

The workflow uses environment variables to configure Exchange notifications. You can set these in a `.env` file or as environment variables in your deployment.

## Required Configuration

*   `EXCHANGE_USERNAME`: The email address of the account sending notifications (e.g., `user@company.com`).
*   `EXCHANGE_PASSWORD`: The password for the Exchange account.

## Optional Configuration

*   `EXCHANGE_EWS_URL`: The EWS endpoint URL (if autodiscover fails or is not used).
*   `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL`: The recipient email address for notifications (defaults to `admin@company.com`).

Note: Previous instructions to use a Prefect Secret block are deprecated. Please use environment variables for configuration.
