# Instructions for Setting Up Exchange Notifications

To enable Exchange notifications for flow failures, you must create a Prefect Secret block with your Exchange password.

1.  **Access Prefect UI**:
    Open your Prefect Cloud or Server dashboard.

2.  **Navigate to Blocks**:
    Click on the "Blocks" icon in the sidebar.

3.  **Add a New Block**:
    Click the "+" button to add a new block.

4.  **Select Secret**:
    Search for "Secret" and select the "Secret" block type (under System).

5.  **Configure the Block**:
    *   **Block Name**: `exchange-password` (This must match exactly).
    *   **Value**: Enter your Exchange/Office 365 password.

6.  **Save**:
    Click "Create" to save the block.

## Optional Configuration

You can configure the sender email and Exchange EWS URL using environment variables:

*   `EXCHANGE_USERNAME`: The email address of the account sending notifications (defaults to `user@company.com`).
*   `EXCHANGE_EWS_URL`: The EWS endpoint URL (if autodiscover fails or is not used).

The recipient is configured via the application settings (`notification_email`).
