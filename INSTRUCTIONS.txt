1.  **Access Prefect UI**:
    Open your Prefect Cloud or Server dashboard.

2.  **Navigate to Blocks**:
    Click on the "Blocks" icon in the sidebar.

3.  **Add a New Block**:
    Click the "+" button to add a new block.

4.  **Select Secret**:
    Search for "Secret" and select the "Secret" block type (under System).

5.  **Configure the Block**:
    *   **Block Name**: `exchange-password` (This must match exactly).
    *   **Value**: Enter your Exchange/Office 365 password.

6.  **Save**:
    Click "Create" to save the block.

Your workflow is now configured to load this password securely and send failure notifications via Exchange Web Services.
